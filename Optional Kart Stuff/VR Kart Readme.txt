If you need to replace the 64-bit executable with the 32-bit one, just copy all the files in the folder into the folder with "srb2.exe" in it. Overwrite when asked to.

To use the VR mod, just drop both of the files in "SRB2Kart VR" into the "Karts Never Say Die" folder. Then launch "srb2kart_vr.exe" instead of the other one.
I haven't tested this with all the addons we have so I have no idea how well it will work.
