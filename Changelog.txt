--- Changelog- Ver 2.7 ---

- Saturn was updated to v9.2. Saturn Devs are cannibalizing Ring Racers' modern lua codes and I am here for it. Here's the link to the changelog: https://github.com/Indev450/SRB2Kart-Saturn/releases

- Notably the "offline" / "local" ping delay system from Ring Racers is here. This will let me force a GLOBAL frame delay, essentially nerfing "host advantage". The default delay will be 4. Pray I do not alter it further.

- Fixed some addon load errors and probably introduced new ones. Whoops, fuck it we ball.

- Added more map fixes by Cola
- Added beta version of The ThunderDome map by Jora. Needs testing badly.
- Added a map pack of Hat in Time maps. I bet they won't work right lmao.
- Added Splintered Steeple
- Broke the Midnight Channels' minimaps.


--- Changelog- Ver 2.5(b) ---

- Saturn was updated to v7. Shitload of bugfixes and stability things in their changelog: https://github.com/Indev450/SRB2Kart-Saturn/releases/tag/v7.2

- Added (and deactivated now because it's passed) the Halloween-theming pack. It's still in the downloads folder and you can manually apply it by editing the "server host" bat if you desperately want the spooky title screen.

- Fixed an issue with the Blue Shell cooldown not being long enough.
- Changed Shrink Potion odds (appears near the middle of the pack more)

- Added Crash Cove, a CTR map made by Cola!
- Added Papu's Pyramid, a CTR map made by Cola!
- Also added several map fixes done by Cola.

- Added Mist's OC Jamie as a dub and appearance for Tails.
- Added Scoria as a dub and appearance for Robit. The appearance only gives her a 3D model for now.
- Added Oracle as a dub and appearance for Cola.

- Removed the Gagmicrophone. I hate it.
- Removed the Shrink Potion. Trash. Useless. Why did it even exist?
- Reverted the Magnet to its old version.

- Continued investigation on issues with 3D models and alt appearances. Characters that have a model, but the last frame is not their goal sign will display their crush sprite on the sign. Fixes ongoing.


--- Changelog- Ver 2.4b ---

- Moved changelog to its own file due to all your fucking bitching.

- WE ARE NOW USING GITHUB. Sonikku has written a program to do updates through github instead of having to deal with SRB2K's native downloading/my constant updating. Instructions for it are in the "NOT OPTIONAL INSTRUCTIONS" text file.

- We're still using Saturn as the modified SRB2K Client. More info if you need it in the "Optional Kart Stuff" folder. 
- The VR Client is still included. Requires some minor setup, there's a readme for it in the "Optional Kart Stuff" folder.
		You can also see the mod post here: https://mb.srb2.org/addons/sonic-kart-vr-mod.2436/
- BattlePlus is included, but we've found it's not fully set up! Working non fixing it, will release a patch with that later
	- Full documentation here: https://mb.srb2.org/addons/srb2kart-battle-plus-kl_bp-v2-0-pk3.2350/

- Fixed the Shrink potion and made it more rare.
- Fixed the Blue Spring and made it more rare.
- Modified Takkon to make him rarer and his item cooldown longer.

- Character Changes:

Updated a few karts to have their appearances from Ring Racers.
Removed models for a few characters.
Tikal is now an alt appearance and dub for Chaos.
Sonic.Exe is now an alt appearance and dub for Sonic (Exe).
Majora now has a dub for her original voice (Grey).
Robit now has a dub for (Scoria) and her original voice (Aero).
Kasane Teto is now an alt appearance and dub for Miku.
Attempted to fix some sprite conflicts.

You can find a complete list of characters, alts, and dubs in the "Full Character List and Reference.txt" file.

We are at nearly max slots again. Going forward, if you would like to have a character added, consider that there is the option to add them as an alt skin and dub for another character we already have.

- Remember that a secret function has been added to CUSTOM ACTION 1. Legends say that utilizing it has something to do with the power of "duos" and "pairs". Maybe try double-tapping it sometimes?
