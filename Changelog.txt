--- Changelog- Ver 2.4b ---

- Moved changelog to its own file due to all your fucking bitching.

- WE ARE NOW USING GITHUB. Sonikku has written a program to do updates through github instead of having to deal with SRB2K's native downloading/my constant updating. Instructions for it are in the "NOT OPTIONAL INSTRUCTIONS" text file.

- We're still using Saturn as the modified SRB2K Client. More info if you need it in the "Optional Kart Stuff" folder. 
- The VR Client is still included. Requires some minor setup, there's a readme for it in the "Optional Kart Stuff" folder.
		You can also see the mod post here: https://mb.srb2.org/addons/sonic-kart-vr-mod.2436/
- BattlePlus is included, but we've found it's not fully set up! Working non fixing it, will release a patch with that later
	- Full documentation here: https://mb.srb2.org/addons/srb2kart-battle-plus-kl_bp-v2-0-pk3.2350/

- Fixed the Shrink potion and made it more rare.
- Fixed the Blue Spring and made it more rare.
- Modified Takkon to make him rarer and his item cooldown longer.

- Character Changes:

Updated a few karts to have their appearances from Ring Racers.
Removed models for a few characters.
Tikal is now an alt appearance and dub for Chaos.
Majora now has a dub for her original voice (Grey).
Robit now has a dub for Scoria.
Oracle (Daiidalus OC) is now an alt for Bunnie Rabbot.

You can find a complete list of characters, alts, and dubs in the "Full Character List and Reference.txt" file.

We are at nearly max slots again. Going forward, if you would like to have a character added, consider that there is the option to add them as an alt skin and dub for another character we already have.

- Remember that a secret function has been added to CUSTOM ACTION 1. Legends say that utilizing it has something to do with the power of "duos" and "pairs". Maybe try double-tapping it sometimes?
